# EduMPC

Simple educational MPC brick set based on libp2p

SepiorSDK - This branch has been created to test Sepior MPC SDK

It expects the Sepior Client SDK to be available locally (or one needs to login to gitlab)
Edit the "replace" directive in the go.mod file to point to your local SDK:
`replace gitlab.com/sepior/go-tsm-sdk => /home/yourusr/go/src/gitlab.com/go-tsm-sdk`
